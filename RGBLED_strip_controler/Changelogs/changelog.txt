0.1
changed pfade[] to pinFV[]
changed pdelay[] to pinDelay[]
changed pvalue[] to pinV[]
Adjusted loop behavior
0.2
pins[], pinFV[], pinV[], pinDelay[] moved to pins[][];
changed readAnalogDecode() to rAD();
altered the rainbow (mode 0) if(){} statement;
0.3
Setup a catch method
Setup analogAverage(aA(){})
Setup additional analog input for delays/speed control
0.4
pinFader(){} Now supports mode 5 Split rainbow
setup speedStrip() for speed select / atrip select
removed cob()
0.5
adjusted speedStrip()
split RGBSolidSeperate into RGBSolidSeperateOne() and RGBSolidSeperateTwo
	-funtion was not working when trying to control both strips at the same time
adjusted loop()
0.6
added pinFaderM5() due to issues fading pins in mode 5
removed unused Serial.print methods
0.6.1
changed int mode to volatile int mode for use in interupt
added interupt from pin 2
added interFunction() for use when pin two receives a HIGH signal
commented out modes 2 and 3 in loop and rAD()as they are not used
added anotations
0.6.2
added int fountinpin = 13
added houseLights(int pin, int value)
added fountain() for on/off control of a water fountain attached to pin 13
